"""
Paper Piano Record function will be nice to move into this project
due to its ability to toggle an input.
Room Project's GUI will also be nice to cannibalize with the right side
showing the current inputs being made.
The left side showing which of the 4 gates have been solved and when complete.
The right side will hold the shifted text for them to solve.
